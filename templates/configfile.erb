# functionality. Because of this, you will need to carefully and
# exhaustively test any application of this option. And you are
# recommended to use filesystem permissions for any important security
# policies due to their greater reliability. Supported regex syntax is
# any number of *, ? and unnested {,} operators. Regex matching is only
